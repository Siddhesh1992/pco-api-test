to be installed globally. You will also need a database explorer like HeidiSQL, pgAdmin etc for connecting to the database.\nInstallation\n\nClone the pco-api repository from GitHub.\nThen enter the pco-api directory using command cd pco-api.\nRun the initial installation of all modules using command npm install.\n\nEnvironment Variables\nCreate a .env.development and .env file at the root of the directory and add the following environment variables.\n\nOKTA_AUDIENCE='api://default'\nOKTA_ISSUER='https://dev-00136695.okta.com/oauth2/default'\nOKTA_CLIENT_ID=0oa492y4g4lJRRJJP5d7\nOKTA_INTROSPECT_URL=https://dev-00136695.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/introspect\nOKTA_USERINFO_URL=https://cbsi.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo\nAWS_ASSUME_ROLE=viacbs-inventory-app-ro\nAWS_ACCOUNTS='{\"viacbs-app-dev\":\"421771595440\"}'\nDATABASE_URL=\"postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/database?schema=public\"\nNEW_RELIC_API_URL='https://api.newrelic.com/graphql'\nNEW_RELIC_API_KEY=NRAK-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\nNEW_RELIC_MASTER_ACCOUNT=766473\nSERVICE_NOW_USERNAME=XXXXXX\nSERVICE_NOW_PASSWORD=XXXXXX\nSERVICE_NOW_URL=https://viacomcbsdev.service-now.com/\nSERVICE_NOW_TABLE_URL=api/now/table/\nSERVICE_NOW_CI_URL=vcsp\nSERVICE_NOW_CHANGE_REQUEST=change_request\nSERVICE_NOW_CONFIGURATION_ITEMS=cmdb_ci\nSERVICE_NOW_ADD_CONFIGURATION_ITEMS=task_ci\nSERVICE_NOW_KEY_CLIENT_LIST=u_m2m_users_ci_keycl\n\nExternal
